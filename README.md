## Development

To run this reporting tool, you must install [Python3](https://www.python.org/). The easiest way for MacOS is to install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). If you use a different operating system, please [download and install](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3124/) the necessary tools beforehand.

```bash
# Install Python3 using Homebrew
brew install python
```

### Installation

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fhildeb/validator-income-reporter.git

# Create a Virtual Python Environment
python3 -m venv income-reporter-tool

# Install necessary dependencies
pip3 install requests install pandas fpdf
```

### Configuration

You can configure this report tool to work with any blockchain or coin. You can copy and modify a global configuration file to your liking. Complete documentation can be found [within the config file](./config-sample.py).

```bash
# Copy the sample configuration file
cp config-sample.py config.py
```

1. Open the `config.py` file
2. Edit the `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY`
3. Set your `ETH1_ADDRESS` and `YEAR`
4. Choose the `COINMARKETCAP_FIAT_ID` and `COINMARKETCAP_CRYPTO_ID`
5. Define the `COIN_NAME` and `FIAT_CURRENCY`
6. Specify the `REPORT_TITLE`

**By default, the report will be generated for the LUKSO Blockchain**

If you want to create a report for a different [EVM-based Network](https://www.coincarp.com/chainlist/) modify the:

1. API endpoints at `BLOCKSCOUT_API_URL` and `COINMARKETCAP_API_URL`
2. Cryptocurrency at `COINMARKETCAP_CRYPTO_ID` and `COIN_NAME`
3. Blockchain explorer referenced at the `EXPLORER_LINK`

### Startup

```bash
# Activate the Virtual Python Environment
source python-tool/bin/activate

# Run Income Reporter Script
python3 income_reporter.py
```

### Shutdown

After the tool finished sucessfully, you will see the generated CSV and PDF files within the folder. They are both called income report and include the year and your address within the file name. After the files have been generated, the virtual environment can be deactivated.

```bash
# Deactivate the Virtual Python Environment
deactivate
```
