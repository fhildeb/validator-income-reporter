LUKSO Disclaimer: for LYX income reports for 2023, its recommended to use the 
CRYPTO_ID of the LYXe token, instead of the LYX coin. This is because withdrawals 
got enabled in June 2023, while LYX was listed on the first exchange end of July. 
Due to a big liquidity pool being actively bridged from LYXe, both crypto assets 
only had minimal price fluctuations. For 2024 and beyond, please always use LYX.
